## HTML5 Semantic Elements

Semantic elements have special meaning and describes it meaning to the browser. For instance, _<div>_ and _<span>_ are not semantic elements because they do not give any meaning to a browser. However, _<header>_ or _<foot>_ is a semantic element because it clearly describe and defines its content.
List of some semantic elements:

```bash
 <article>
 <aside>
 <details>
 <figcaption>
 <figure>
 <footer>
 <header>
 <main>
 <mark>
 <nav>

 <section>
 <summary>
 <time>
```
